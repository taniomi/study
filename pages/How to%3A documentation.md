- # Why write documentation?
	- For you:
		- You will be using your code in 6 months
		- You want people to use your code and give you credit
		- You want to learn self-determination
		- Others would be encouraged to contribute to your code
	- For others:
		- Others can easily use your code and build upon it
	- For science:
		- Advance the science
		- Encourage open science
		- Allow reproducibility and transparency
		  
		  What should you document about your research? Everything! All the data, notes, code, and materials someone else would need to reproduce your work.
		  
		  Consider the following questions:
	- **How is your data gathered?**
	- **What variables did you use?**
	- **Did you use any code to clean/analyze your data?**
