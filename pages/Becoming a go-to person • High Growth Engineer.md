- ## How to become known as an expert
	- Examples:
		- Lead projects reliably and successfully. Even just by yourself.
			- For my first few projects at Gusto, I made sure to go the extra mile. I stayed in close sync with my manager and made sure I was meeting and going above the expectations where I could.
		- ==Say you’ll do the thing. Do the thing. Say you did it.== Follow this framework to keep people in the loop of the request they made and the progress.
			- Only doing “do the thing” is allowing your work to speak for itself, which unfortunately is not what will get you the most value in the business world. It also doesn’t help your team either since they’re not up to date.
		- Be visible in Slack. Answer questions. Make announcements.
			- There are often eng-help channels you can try to answer questions in. If you often answer questions in a particular domain or technological area, over time people will start seeing you as the expert.
		- Solve unowned problems in a domain or technological area.
			- I set up patterns for handling GraphQL N+1 queries then I ran a presentation explaining how to use those patterns to improve our performance.
		- Writing documentation and sharing about it
			- I set up documentation on how to debug performance issues in tests. This offloads responsibility from me but still points me as the expert.
		- Creating a cool tool that solves a problem for the team
			- I saw our team doing a bunch of manual work when importing translations from our translation service. I set up a CLI tool to allow them to run a single command to do the importing process.
		- Lead an initiative that brings together teams
			- I got together a few teams to align on API consistency patterns since our GraphQL schema was getting complicated for our primary consumer, the Mobile team.
		- Create a guild or working group
			- I didn’t create, but led the Frontend guild for a short period. This positioned me as an expert within the org, or at least someone who was resourceful and could point you to the right place for what you need.
		- Lead a recurring meeting across teams
			- I set up a bi-weekly sync between our team and our primary API consumer, the Mobile team to prevent surprises and keep a good relationship between us.
