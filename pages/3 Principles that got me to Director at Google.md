- # The 3 Key Principles
	- ## Glue
		- Being Glue or doing Glue work is about those tasks that are boring and necessary, but don't showcase technical skill. Like 1:1s, meetings, reviews.
		- This work **is** important, but if there's too much glue work, you don't do your actual work. You help others and facilitate so that they do their work, but yours is neglected.
		- So, balance glue work and technical work.
		- ### In defense of glue work
			- Glue work is your opportunity to show leadership skills.
			- Glue work involves people and facilitating their work, so that everything comes together.
		- > You need to balance leadership examples and technical deliverables to get a promotion.
	- ## Grit
		- Grit is about being able to take hits and stand up again. It is about being resilient and knowing that you can only be a loser if you stop trying altogether.
	- ## Friction
		- Friction is the delta between the ideal and reality.
		- Search for things you can do to reduce that delta.
		- Offer to take on some task, offer help, prepare beforehand so that you don't have to look for information during a meeting.
		- Don't be blocked in a task and simply sit at the mercy of other people.
